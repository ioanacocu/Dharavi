Dharavi Serious web based game
This is the multiplayer implementation of the original YouPlaceIt game. 
The original project's description and authors can be seen below.
This implementation adds the capacity for the players to communicate with eachother by sending messages- either private or general and decide which of the proposed roads they wish to be built.

Original Description:
# Serious Games in Urban Planning

Urban Planners have to propose plans for construction of roads which is currently done 
physically using hard copies of siteÂ­maps. This makes it difficult for  urban planners who 
are new to this field and also multiple iterations of the same process makes it much more 
difficult. We propose to build a system which acts as a real time simulator and helps to 
digitize the complete scenario in the form of an interactive game. 
This approach saves time for urban planners and also helps to increase their knowledge 
by simulating various use cases using this game.
